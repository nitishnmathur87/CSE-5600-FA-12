These queries cover the resulting RDF graph from the SMART API.

Whatever is needed can be altered from the whole query.

For example, lets take the demographics. If only the email, name is needed for the SMART app then use only the query for that data and the remaining data can be scrapped out. 

After the SELECT statements, whatever variables are needed, they can be acieved by doing, lets say SELECT ?a ?b ?c where ?a,?b and ?c are variables of the data that is desired.

DONOT MODIFY THE FILES. Just use a copy of the files.
